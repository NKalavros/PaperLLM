These methods outperform the others on both legacy (HER2+) and higher-resolution (Visium) spatial transcriptomics datasets[1].\n\n- **Dataset-Specific Leaders:**  \n  - On the **HER2+ dataset** (lower resolution), **BLEEP** and **STimage** show significantly better performance than the other models.\n  - On the **Visium dataset** (higher resolution), **Hist2ST** achieves the highest and most consistent performance across all evaluated genes[1].\n\n- **OOD Generalization:**  \n  In OOD tests (where models are evaluated on data from different distributions/labs), **STimage** demonstrates the highest median performance. **Hist2ST**, while performing very well on validation data, shows a pronounced drop in OOD performance, suggesting a tendency to overfit the training set. BLEEP and STimage demonstrate more robust and consistent OOD performance, likely due to their architectural approaches in dealing with uncertainty and inference strategies[1].\n\n- **Modifications and Additional Techniques:**  \n  Attempts to improve Hist2ST with data augmentation, stain normalization, auxiliary classification loss, pre-trained backbones, or architectural simplification did not result in performance improvements. Notably, using pre-trained encoders even reduced performance, suggesting domain-specific feature learning is critical[1].\n\n### Model Rankings (as described in the study)\n\n| Model      | In-Distribution (ID) | Out-of-Distribution (OOD) | Notes                                                      |\n|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hist2ST    | Top                  | Drops in OOD              | Most accurate on Visium; overfits, less robust OOD         |\n| STimage    | Top                  | Top                       | Most robust across OOD; models uncertainty                 |\n| BLEEP      | Top                  | Top                       | Scalable, robust OOD, uses embedding/nearest-neighbors     |\n| HisToGene  | Moderate             | Moderate                  | Slightly lower than above                                  |\n| ST-Net     | Low                  | Low                       | Consistently lower, below 0.1 median PCC                   |\n| DeepSpaCE  | Low                  | Low                       | Consistently lower, below 0.1 median PCC                   |\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **No single model is best across all scenarios.**  \n  **Hist2ST** is the highest performer on in-distribution (particularly Visium) data, but **STimage** and **BLEEP** exhibit greater robustness and generalizability, especially for OOD data[1].\n- **STimage** is highlighted as the top model for generalization to new, unseen datasets, an essential criterion for practical applications, while **Hist2ST** leads when training and test data are closely matched.\n- The overall performance remains modest for all methods, with median correlations for most genes between 0.1 and 0.3, indicating this is still a challenging, open problem.\n\n> In summary, **Hist2ST, STimage, and BLEEP are the best-performing models according to this study, with STimage and BLEEP showing the most robust out-of-distribution generalization, and Hist2ST excelling on in-distribution data**[1].\n\n---\n\n[1] https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/9GwDVJ69/"}

Only the \"wisdom of the crowd\" (ensemble) approach performed well on both.\n- The top-performing team's approach (\u201cdegree\u201d model) mathematically modeled sequential inhibition by giving one drug, seeing its effect, then simulating the second drug's effect given the first, using gene expression similarities to inform interaction modeling. Notably, there was no training set\u2014participants had to infer synergies from monotherapy data alone[5].\n\n**Insights from Transcriptomics and Biological Mechanisms**\n- New analyses in Gustavo's own lab highlighted the complexity at the molecular level: combining two drugs could result in novel gene expression changes not predictable from the effects of either drug alone.\n- For some combinations, the set of differentially expressed genes was much larger than the union of those affected by individual drugs\u2014implying that synergy at a transcriptional level can create emergent effects[5].\n- Predicting synergy requires a deeper molecular understanding, as many current models, which focus on classical targets, might miss important downstream transcriptional changes.\n\n**Next Steps and New Challenges**\n- Gustavo previewed a new, larger-scale drug combination prediction challenge (in partnership with AstraZeneca and Sanger), expanding from 91 to over 13,000 drug pairs and 1 to 79 cell lines from multiple tissue types[1].\n- In the new challenge, participants would receive only baseline (pre-treatment) molecular data and a training set, reflecting a more practical and scalable approach for real-world applications[1].\n- The field was moving from simply ranking synergy scores to attempting to predict actual synergy values and to identifying the most synergistic partners for a given drug or cell line.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Community challenges can rapidly accelerate research by engaging large groups (90+ researchers from 31 teams participated), often advancing the field by several person-years in just a few months[5].\n- It is possible to predict drug synergy computationally even without direct combinatorial training data, but current methods still have significant limitations.\n- Methods may need to model synergy and antagonism separately; transcriptomic-based predictions require a molecular understanding of emergent gene-level effects.\n- There is a need for new experiments and advanced models to uncover the molecular mechanisms driving synergy.\n- Collaboration, crowdsourcing, and data sharing are essential for advancing in silico methods for drug combination discovery[5][1].\n\n**Broad Takeaway:**  \nComputational challenges like DREAM are crucial for benchmarking and advancing the science of drug synergy prediction. The findings emphasize the complexity of biological systems, the limitations of current models, and the value of collective scientific effort in tackling big biomedical questions[5][1]."}

Here are the main points from his presentation:\n\n1. **Drug Synergy Importance**: Gustavo stressed the importance of synergistic interactions between drugs as a strategy to reduce resistance to treatments. This is vital because cancer treatments often lead to relapses due to acquired resistance.\n\n2. **Challenge Objective**: The DREAM challenge was designed to benchmark methods that could predict drug combinations with synergistic effects. Given the vast number of possible drug combinations (e.g., 1,000 drugs resulting in a million pairs), in silico methods are necessary to prioritize potential combinations effectively.\n\n3. **Challenge Design**: Initially set around 2012, the challenge involved evaluating 91 combinations of 14 drugs in a lymphoma cell line, asking participants to rank these combinations based on their synergistic potential.\n\n4. **Data Provided**: Participants were given rich data, including gene expression profiles before and after treatment, DNA copy number variations, and SNPs, to aid in their predictions.\n\n5. **Synergy Measurement**: The talk detailed how synergy was measured using an \"excess over Bliss independence\" method. He explained the concept of Bliss independence, where drug effects are probabilistically assessed as independent.\n\n6. **Results and Insights**: The challenge uncovered that while some approaches were promising, no method was universally superior. Interestingly, predictions for synergistic and antagonistic interactions seemed to rely on different mechanisms.\n\n7. **Approaches Described**: Gustavo described the methods of the best-performing teams, noting that the prediction models used were purely mathematical and did not involve a training set, only baseline data for monotherapies.\n\n8. **Follow-up Work and New Challenges**: Gustavo's lab pursued further work to understand how synergistic effects manifest at the molecular level, such as through transcriptional changes. Moreover, he announced a scaled-up future challenge that increases the number of combinations and cell lines, aiming to further test the community's capabilities in predicting drug synergy.\n\n9. **Conclusion and Implications**: He concluded that predicting drug synergy is possible without training data but requires better modeling distinctions between synergy and antagonism. Transcriptomics can provide valuable insights into these interactions, suggesting new experiments and computational models are needed to improve predictions.\n\n10. **Discussion Points**: In the Q&A, Gustavo highlighted the complexity of drug targets and the potential of new computational algorithms to predict transcriptional changes as molecular targets. This underscored the evolving understanding of drug interactions beyond classical target-centric approaches."}

This relationship, where something designed to defend against pathogens also holds the potential to cause cancer, paints APOBEC activity as a double-edged sword. Dr. Petljak mentions that the activation of APOBEC mutagenesis occurs even in the absence of the immune system, implying that endogenous factors can trigger these enzymes to mutate DNA rather than their intended target, RNA.

In her talk and associated research, she critically examines the triggers of APOBEC enzyme activity, with an emphasis on the environmental context.\n\n**Key Points from the Transcript and Supporting Research:**\n\n- Dr. Petljak emphasizes that APOBEC enzymes\u2014originally evolved as part of the innate immune response to fight viral infections, particularly retroviruses such as HIV\u2014can sometimes become misdirected, mutating human DNA instead of viral RNA, thus contributing to cancer development. This forms the basis of their role as a \"double-edged sword\" in biology.\n\n> \"As a matter of fact it is APOBEC enzymes that can cause these exact mutation patterns when they're overexpressed in experimental systems in vitro... as it happens, something that actually evolves to protect us from viral infection then also contributes to the development of cancer and as such is a matter of fact a double-edged sword.\"\n\n- The field has been investigating what activates APOBEC enzymes outside their canonical role. Dr. Petljak points out that the primary environmental activator suspected is viral infection. This is rooted in the evolutionary function of APOBECs as defenders against viruses, where the presence of viral DNA or RNA leads to enzyme activation.\n\n> \"What is actually activating these things, so what is making these things go every now and then crazy and mutate human DNA instead of viral RNA?\"\n\n- In her experimental findings, she notes that in cancer cell lines grown without an immune system or viral exposure, APOBEC mutagenesis does not normally occur unless triggered intermittently, suggesting an endogenous or cell-intrinsic component. However, the historical evidence and the signature patterns strongly associate environmental viral challenges\u2014especially latent or chronic viral infections\u2014as the main environmental factor capable of turning on APOBEC mutagenesis in vivo.\n\n- Petljak's lab and related research are actively working to clarify these environmental links by developing models that replicate physiological contexts, specifically aiming to dissect mechanisms through which environmental factors (predominantly viral infection) lead to aberrant APOBEC activity and subsequent mutagenesis[1][2][5].\n\n**Supporting Literature:**\n\n- Multiple studies and Petljak\u2019s own lab summaries agree that environmental factors, and particularly viral infections, are the most prominent environmental triggers. This is in line with the evolutionary purpose of APOBECs. The field continues to seek conclusive, direct evidence in physiological models, but viral infection remains the leading hypothesis for an environmental trigger of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis[1][2][5].\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Dr. Petljak identifies viral infection as the main environmental factor suspected to trigger APOBEC mutagenesis.** This is both historically grounded in the enzyme's immune function against viruses and remains the focal point of ongoing research efforts to demonstrate direct causality in cancer development. The episodic nature of APOBEC activation observed in studies is consistent with intermittent viral challenges as environmental triggers[1][2][5]."}

Their primary concern was not only test accuracy but also model robustness and generalization across datasets generated by different technologies.\n\n**Top-performing Methods**\n\nThe three consistently top-performing methods identified by the authors are:\n\n- **Hist2ST**\n- **BLEEP**\n- **STimage**\n\nAll three methods achieved higher test set performance in both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings compared to the other approaches reviewed. In quantitative terms, these methods yielded the best Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) for gene expression prediction across datasets and gene sets[3].\n\n> \"Top-performing methods: Hist2ST, BLEEP, and STimage consistently achieved higher test set performance for both the in-distribution and OOD settings.\"  \n> \"In general, the best-performing methods are STimage, BLEEP, and Hist2ST, which consistently outperform other methods based on average PCC values across all tissues from different datasets.\"  \n> \"On the HER2+ dataset, the performance of BLEEP and STimage is significantly better than that of the other models. On the Visium dataset, the performance of Hist2ST consistently outperforms other models.\"\n\n**Detailed Comparison of the Best Methods**\n\n| Method   | Strengths                                              | Weaknesses / Notes                                  |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Hist2ST  | Highest performance on Visium (higher-res) data; leverages global and local spatial context; advanced multi-module deep architecture | Shows evidence of overfitting and less OOD robustness; scalability limited due to memory usage with large tissue samples |\n| BLEEP    | Robust performance across datasets; scalable; uses a contrastive embedding approach that may help with OOD generalization | Performance is close to STimage; does not directly predict point-wise expression values |\n| STimage  | Highest median performance on OOD test data; robust, quantifies uncertainty (important for reliability); ensemble strategy improves robustness | Slightly less strong on certain datasets compared to Hist2ST, but most consistently robust especially OOD |\n\n**Which Is the \"Best\" Method?**\n\nThe authors do not name a single absolute best method. Instead, they offer a nuanced conclusion:\n\n- **On high-resolution Visium datasets (in-distribution), Hist2ST often comes out on top.**\n- **On out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets, STimage shows the highest median performance and greater robustness.**\n- **BLEEP is robust, scalable, and demonstrates solid performance, particularly for OOD generalization.**\n\nTheir final assessment prioritizes STimage and BLEEP for robust generalizability, and Hist2ST for slightly higher peak accuracy in ideal (ID) scenarios. They emphasize that overall, no method achieves high prediction accuracy for the majority of genes, and all have significant limitations when it comes to real-world generalization.\n\n> \"For top-performing methods \u2013 Hist2ST, BLEEP, and STimage \u2013 the majority of genes are predicted with a correlation between 0.1 and 0.3.\"\n>\n> \"STimage has the highest median performance on the OOD test data. For Hist2ST, there is a large discrepancy between the high performance on the validation dataset and the lower performance on the test dataset, suggesting possible overfitting to the training data and less generalizability.\"\n>\n> \"The other top-performing methods BLEEP and STimage demonstrate robust and consistent performance in the OOD set, which may be due to their different methods of inference that contrast them from the other methods that directly produce point-wise predictions. For STimage, learning the negative binomial distributions for each gene allows the model to account for noise and variance present in the data.\"\n\n**Model Improvements & Negative Results**\n\n- Attempts to improve Hist2ST with stain normalization, auxiliary classification, pre-trained image encoders, and architectural simplification did **not** yield better results.\n- Pre-trained encoders and simplified architectures performed worse than the original Hist2ST.\n- Image augmentation and different gene expression transformations made little difference.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**There is no single \"best\" method across all settings.** For in-distribution, high-resolution data, **Hist2ST** scores highest, but for general robustness and OOD generalization, **STimage** (and to a similar extent, **BLEEP**) edge ahead. The authors recommend these three as the current state-of-the-art, each with distinct strengths, but they emphasize that all existing methods are limited and cannot yet achieve high accuracy or generalizability for most genes[3]."}

The main bottleneck he identifies in spatial transcriptomics as it stands is the scalability and throughput of these technologies. Imaging methods such as smFISH (single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization) are powerful as they can map up to the entire transcriptome at the level of single molecules, but they are extremely tedious, time-consuming, and not easily scalable to high content and large sample volumes.\n\nDr. Fan highlights that the real breakthrough came with high-throughput sequencing-based spatial mapping, which introduced the ability to use sequencing technologies (like those from Illumina) to reconstruct spatial gene expression profiles. This approach allows for higher content and larger sample numbers, moving toward more scalable solutions. However, despite these advancements, there remains a challenge in achieving very high-resolution mapping, such as one-micron spatial resolution, and in further integrating multi-omics data in a scalable manner. Additionally, each tissue type may require specific optimizations, adding another layer of complexity."}

He notes that while technologies like single-molecule FISH and advanced imaging can provide high-resolution spatial maps\u2014up to the whole transcriptome scale\u2014these approaches are extremely tedious, time-consuming, and ultimately do not scale efficiently to large numbers of samples or tissue volumes. Conversely, next-generation sequencing-based spatial methods (like those developed by 10x Genomics and others) offer better scalability and higher throughput, but often at the cost of spatial resolution or the number of detectable features per experiment.\n\nFan highlights that most current spatial transcriptomics methods face trade-offs between these factors:\n\n- **Spatial Resolution:** Achieving true single-cell or subcellular resolution remains challenging, and as the pixel size decreases (e.g., to 10 microns), there is still a risk that more than one cell may contribute to a single pixel's signal, complicating downstream analysis.\n- **Molecular Content:** While some methods can interrogate the whole transcriptome, measuring hundreds or thousands of proteins, or integrating additional information (like epigenomic data) in the same assay, is still a technical hurdle.\n- **Scalability and Throughput:** Methods that provide high-content and resolution are often limited in how many samples, how large an area, or how many conditions can be analyzed in a reasonable time frame. This becomes especially apparent when dealing with clinical specimens or large tissue landscapes.\n\nFan specifically states that, despite major advances, existing ST technologies \"do not really give you the ability to scale and to get high content and a large volume and also a large sample number,\" making scalability and multiplexing a central bottleneck for broader application in biomedical research and clinical settings. The need to process various tissue types, often requiring extensive optimization, further complicates the deployment of these methods widely.\n\nIn summary, Dr. Fan sees the current main bottleneck in spatial transcriptomics as the inability to achieve, in a single platform and workflow, high spatial resolution, high molecular content (multi-omics capabilities), and high scalability\u2014all of which are essential for unlocking the full potential of spatial omics in research and medicine. His work aims to address this by developing new methods that push the boundaries across all these dimensions."}

The main purpose of this challenge was to improve the understanding and prediction of how different drugs interact synergistically to combat diseases such as cancer. This approach is significant because combining drugs can potentially overcome resistance to treatments and improve overall effectiveness while minimizing side effects.\n\nKey points Gustavo covered include:\n\n1. **Drug Synergy:** The focus was on synergistic interactions between drugs and how these interactions can be beneficial in medical treatments, especially in cancer therapy, to reduce treatment resistance.\n\n2. **Challenge Overview:** The challenge aimed to benchmark methods for predicting which combinations of drugs would work synergistically. Participants were provided data on 14 drugs and asked to rank combinations based on their synergistic potential.\n\n3. **Data and Evaluation:** Participants were given detailed data, including gene expression profiles, to make their predictions. The evaluation was based on how well their predictions matched actual data.\n\n4. **Measurement of Synergy:** Various methods for measuring drug synergy were discussed, including the \"excess over Bliss independence\" which is a statistical measure used to evaluate if the combined effect of two drugs is greater than expected from their individual effects.\n\n5. **Outcomes and Future Work:** The results showed that while some predictions were better than random chance, there was room for improvement, indicating \"half-full\" potential for finding valuable signals. Future work involves scaling up the project to include more drug combinations and cell lines and introducing more comprehensive data sets.\n\n6. **Molecular Understanding:** Gustavo touched upon the importance of understanding drug synergy at the molecular level, particularly how combined drug actions manifest at the transcription level, revealing insights into gene expression changes when drugs are used together.\n\n7. **Algorithm Development:** He mentioned that there are algorithms being developed to infer new molecular targets that can emerge from transcriptional changes, highlighting a shift towards a more nuanced understanding of drug targets beyond traditional molecular targets like EGFR or HER2.\n\nIn essence, Gustavo's talk was about advancing the scientific and computational methods for understanding and predicting drug interactions, which holds promise for more effective and personalized medical treatments."}

His presentation covered several key points about their research efforts to identify effective drug combinations for cancer therapy.\n\n## Key Points from Gustavo's Presentation\n\nGustavo explained that the DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) Challenge was established to benchmark computational methods for predicting synergistic drug combinations. This is important because:\n\n- Cancer treatments often develop resistance, so combination therapies are needed to improve survival rates\n- Testing all possible drug combinations experimentally is impractical (with 1,000 drugs, there would be 1 million possible pairs)\n- Computational methods can help \"triage\" or prioritize which combinations to test experimentally\n\nThe original challenge (DREAM 7, conducted around 2012) involved:\n- 14 drugs and their 91 possible pair combinations\n- Participants were asked to rank combinations from most to least synergistic\n- All testing was done on a single cell line (LY3, a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line)\n- Rich datasets were provided, including gene expression data at different time points, drug response curves, and genomic information\n\n## Measuring Synergy and Results\n\nGustavo explained that they measured synergy using \"excess over Bliss independence,\" which compares the actual inhibition achieved by a combination versus what would be expected if the drugs acted independently. The challenge results showed:\n\n- Only three submissions achieved statistically significant predictive power\n- The best performers were far from perfect but demonstrated that there is predictive signal in the data\n- Interestingly, methods good at predicting synergistic combinations were poor at predicting antagonistic ones, and vice versa\n- The \"wisdom of crowds\" solution (aggregating all predictions) performed well for both synergy and antagonism\n\n## Molecular Understanding of Synergy\n\nGustavo's lab further investigated what synergy means at the molecular level:\n\n- They found that when highly synergistic drugs are combined, many new genes become differentially expressed that weren't affected by either drug alone\n- This suggests that synergy emerges from complex interactions where some genes respond only when both drugs are present\n- In contrast, non-synergistic combinations typically showed gene expression patterns dominated by just one of the drugs\n\n## Future Directions\n\nGustavo concluded by discussing the next challenge (DREAM 10):\n\n- It would be significantly scaled up from 91 combinations to 13,000 and from 1 cell line to 79\n- Unlike the previous challenge, it would include training data and a leaderboard\n- The focus would shift from ranking synergy to predicting specific synergy scores and identifying the most synergistic combinations for specific cell lines\n\nThe ultimate goal is to accelerate research in this field, as these challenges have already demonstrated they can compress years of research into months by bringing many researchers together on a focused problem."}

This combination allows for the development of more interpretable and mechanistically insightful models that can predict therapeutic outcomes more accurately and guide further experimental validation.

To make the predictions more accurate, interpretable, and truly useful for understanding disease mechanisms and predicting therapy outcomes, it is essential to integrate biological knowledge\u2014especially mechanistic and pathway-based information\u2014into computational models.**\n\n### Key Points Elaborated\n\n- **Limitations of Pure Machine Learning:** Dr. Saez-Rodriguez highlights that black-box machine learning models applied directly to omics data have limited predictive capacity for therapy response, and crucially, their predictions are often not mechanistically interpretable\u2014it's hard to know *why* a model makes a prediction or what drives the biological effect[4].\n\n- **Role of Biological Knowledge:** He argues for systematically incorporating biological knowledge (such as known pathways, protein-protein interactions, regulatory networks) into modeling. Doing so enables the extraction of a smaller number of mechanistically relevant features from the thousands of molecular measurements, boosting both statistical power and biological interpretability[4].\n\n- **Mechanistic \"Footprint\" Approach:** Instead of just measuring molecules (like RNA or proteins) and assuming their quantities reflect pathway activities, Saez-Rodriguez describes using knowledge of downstream effects (the \"footprints\") of pathways or transcription factors to infer their actual activities in a given sample. This provides a better readout of biological processes from omics data[4][1].\n\n- **Multi-Modal Integration and Network Models:** His group develops tools (e.g., OmniPath for curated biological interactions, COSMOS for causal inference across multiple omics) to map these mechanistic features onto large networks, extracting biologically plausible causal paths that can be tested experimentally\u2014making the models useful for generating hypotheses and guiding further experiments[4].\n\n- **Importance of Dynamics and Perturbation Data:** Dr. Saez-Rodriguez stresses that predicting how a drug will affect a disease state from static (baseline) data is fundamentally challenging. He advocates for dynamic, mechanistic models\u2014using perturbation data\u2014so that models can simulate a system's response over time, not just at steady state[1][2]. This is critical for robust prediction of therapy responses.\n\n- **Combining Approaches for Personalized Medicine:** He concludes that the best path forward for personalized medicine is not to rely solely on data-driven or black-box methods, but to blend these with mechanistic modeling and biological insight, tailored to specific contexts using patient- and disease-specific data. This hybrid approach improves both the reliability and explanatory power of personalized predictions[4][5].\n\n### In His Own Summary\n\nToward the end, Dr. Saez-Rodriguez summarizes:\n\n> \"Machine learning is a very powerful toolbox that can be applied in the context of personalized medicine to analyze all these large omics data but ... it\u2019s very helpful to use biological knowledge to help the machine learning ... how specific changes downstream can tell you about what happened in your key process of interest more upstream ... we think there is value in combining this machine learning with more dynamic models ... taking biological knowledge from databases ... by training it to data that is more specific to a particular organ, a particular disease context, we can make these patient specific models ... and use them to understand what's going on [and] to predict the effect of new therapies.\" [4]\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Aspect                         | Black-box ML Alone   | Saez-Rodriguez's Hybrid Approach           |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Predictive Power              | Limited              | Improved with mechanistic features         |\n| Interpretability              | Poor                 | Strong (biologically meaningful)           |\n| Use of Biological Knowledge   | Minimal              | Systematic (pathways, networks, footprints)|\n| Response to Perturbation      | Weak                 | Enhanced via dynamic, mechanistic models   |\n| Personalization Potential     | Moderate             | High (by integrating patient-specific data)|\n\n## Takeaway\n\n**The biggest point Dr. Saez-Rodriguez makes is that personalized medicine advances most when computational models couple the scale and flexibility of machine learning with the explanatory and predictive power of biological, mechanistic knowledge\u2014moving from mere correlation to causal, interpretable, and actionable insight.**[4][1][2]"}

The method factored in gene expression profiles to assess the similarity and consistency of the differential expression induced by the drug pairs. The process involved a mathematical model that estimated the inhibition resulting from the pair, compared it against the bliss independence model, and determined the synergistic or antagonistic nature of the drug pairs. Notably, this method did not use a training set, relying purely on mathematical modeling and monotherapy data."}
