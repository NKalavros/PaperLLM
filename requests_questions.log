These APOBEC enzyme-induced signatures (signatures 2 and 13) are prevalent in nearly 80% of human cancers and contribute significantly to mutation loads in individual tumors. Recent studies reveal their involvement in driving mutations in cancer through episodic activation rather than a continuous process. The research also identifies APOBEC3A as a primary mutator, supported by empirical evidence in breast cancer cell lines, thus providing a clearer genetic explanation for its role in mutagenesis and cancer development."}

His research demonstrated that the polyfunctional strength index (PSI) of T cells, measuring their ability to co-produce multiple cytokines, correlates significantly with patient response to immunotherapy[5].\n\nMore recently, Dr. Fan pioneered spatial multi-omics technologies through deterministic barcoding in tissue (DBiT), which allows for high-resolution mapping of whole transcriptomes and hundreds of proteins directly on tissue sections[1]. This approach differs from other spatial transcriptomics technologies by introducing DNA barcodes into tissue rather than extracting RNA, enabling simultaneous analysis of transcriptomes and proteomes within their spatial context[5].\n\nThe seminar also highlighted Dr. Fan's groundbreaking work in spatial epigenomics, developing methods to map chromatin accessibility and histone modifications directly in tissue, revealing tissue-specific epigenetic regulatory patterns at single-cell resolution[1]."}

Saez-Rodriguez emphasizes that pure machine learning approaches alone have limited predictive capability for drug efficacy, but incorporating biological knowledge through pathway analysis and network models significantly improves prediction accuracy[3][5].\n\nA key innovation presented is using \"footprint methods\" to estimate the activity of important cellular components (kinases, transcription factors) from downstream molecular changes rather than direct measurement, which proves more accurate than conventional approaches[3]. The research also demonstrates the value of integrating multiple omics data types through a framework called COSMOS, which identifies causal links connecting different molecular processes[3][4].\n\nThe presentation highlights the challenges of translating these approaches to patient samples, showing how microfluidics technologies can conduct mini-experiments with small tissue amounts to build patient-specific dynamic logic models that can predict effective drug combinations[4][5]. Finally, Saez-Rodriguez discusses how crowdsourcing efforts through DREAM challenges have advanced the field by bringing together diverse computational approaches and demonstrating the \"wisdom of crowds\" effect in improving predictions[4][5]."}

They are cytidine deaminases, which means they can modify cytosine bases in DNA or RNA by deaminating them to uracil. In the context of human biology, APOBEC enzymes were initially known for their role in innate immunity, where they act on viral RNA, including retroviruses like HIV, as part of the body's defense mechanisms.\n\nThese enzymes have been found to be involved in mutagenesis, particularly in cancer. Specific mutational signatures, labeled as signature 2 and signature 13, characterized by C-to-T, C-to-G, and C-to-A mutations, are associated with the activity of APOBECs. These signatures are prevalent across a wide range of cancer types and contribute significantly to the mutational burden in cancers such as breast, bladder, head and neck, lung, and others.\n\nOne of the key APOBEC enzymes involved in mutagenesis in cancer is APOBEC3A, which has been shown to induce mutations in specific sequence contexts. The enzyme's activity can cause \"mutational showers\" or clusters of mutations, particularly affecting cytosines within certain nucleotide contexts. There is an ongoing debate and research into understanding the precise role of different APOBEC family members in cancer, their mechanisms of action, and how they are activated in tumor cells, as these enzymes evolve to target viral RNA but also inadvertently impact the human genome.\n\nResearchers continue to study APOBECs to determine the detailed mechanisms of their involvement in cancer and explore the implications for cancer development as well as potential therapeutic targets."}

These enzymes have garnered considerable attention in cancer research due to their association with specific mutational signatures found across multiple cancer types.\n\n## Structure and Evolution\n\nThe APOBEC family consists of 10 highly homologous enzymes in humans that evolved relatively recently through duplication of an ancestral gene on chromosome 22[2][3]. The family includes:\n\n- APOBEC1: Expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and immune cells (in mice), primarily targeting apolipoprotein B mRNA[2]\n- APOBEC2: Functions as a transcriptional repressor by binding to DNA at specific promoter regions rather than deaminating RNA or DNA[2]\n- APOBEC3 subfamily: Comprises seven members (designated A3A to A3H) with A3A being identified as a primary driver of mutations[2]\n\nAll APOBEC enzymes share a highly homologous deaminase domain, which is crucial for their enzymatic function[3].\n\n## Primary Biological Function\n\nAPOBECs originally evolved as part of the innate immune system to protect against viral infections[3]. Their primary function involves:\n\n1. Deaminating cytosines in viral RNA and DNA (particularly in retroviruses and retrotransposons)\n2. Creating mutations in viral genomes that prevent successful viral replication\n3. Serving as a defense mechanism against pathogens like HIV[3]\n\nThis protective role represents an interesting paradox in biology\u2014enzymes that evolved to defend the human body can also contribute to cancer development under certain circumstances.\n\n## Role in Cancer Mutagenesis\n\nAPOBECs have been implicated in some of the most prevalent mutational signatures in cancer, particularly signatures 2 and 13, which were first discovered in breast cancer in 2012-2013[1][3]. These signatures are characterized by:\n\n- Mutations at cytosine bases, specifically C-to-T, C-to-G, or C-to-A mutations\n- A preference for cytosines preceded by a thymine base (TC context)[3]\n- Found in approximately 80% of all cancer types, contributing to more than a third of individual cancers in major affected types[3]\n\nThe prevalence of these mutational signatures has been observed across numerous cancer types, including breast, bladder, head and neck, lung, cervical, and many others[3].\n\n## APOBEC3A vs. APOBEC3B Debate\n\nWhile both APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B were initially considered potential drivers of cancer mutations, growing evidence points to APOBEC3A as the primary mutagenic enzyme:\n\n1. **Genetic evidence**: A common germline polymorphism that deletes the majority of the APOBEC3B sequence is associated with increased risk of breast cancer and higher burdens of signatures 2 and 13[3]\n\n2. **Sequence preference analysis**: Although both enzymes create similar mutation patterns, closer examination reveals that APOBEC3A prefers pyrimidine bases at the -2 position, while APOBEC3B prefers purine bases\u2014cancer mutations typically show the APOBEC3A pattern[3]\n\n3. **Direct experimental evidence**: Studies with human cancer cell lines demonstrate that knocking out APOBEC3A significantly reduces mutation acquisition, while APOBEC3B deletion has little effect[3]\n\n## Characteristics of APOBEC Mutagenesis\n\nAPOBEC-driven mutations in cancer exhibit several distinctive features:\n\n1. **Episodic activity**: Unlike other mutational processes, APOBEC mutagenesis occurs in intermittent bursts rather than continuously[3]\n\n2. **Mutational showers**: APOBECs can create clusters of mutations referred to as \"mutational showers\" or \"kataegis\" (from the Greek word for thunderstorm)[3]\n\n3. **Secondary DNA structures**: Recent research suggests APOBECs preferentially target cytosines in sequence contexts that form loop structures[3]\n\n## Significance in Cancer Research\n\nUnderstanding APOBEC mutagenesis is crucial because:\n\n1. It represents one of the major mutational processes in human cancer, contributing to tumor evolution and heterogeneity[1][2]\n\n2. In breast cancer specifically, APOBEC contributes to immunogenic mutations that may enhance response to immune checkpoint inhibitors[2]\n\n3. Identifying APOBEC as a key driver of mutations provides potential targets for therapeutic intervention\n\nThe relationship between APOBECs and cancer exemplifies a biological \"double-edged sword\"\u2014enzymes that evolved to protect against viral infections can, under certain circumstances, contribute to cancer development through their DNA-mutating capabilities[3]."}
