Only the \"wisdom of the crowd\" (ensemble) approach performed well on both.\n- The top-performing team's approach (\u201cdegree\u201d model) mathematically modeled sequential inhibition by giving one drug, seeing its effect, then simulating the second drug's effect given the first, using gene expression similarities to inform interaction modeling. Notably, there was no training set\u2014participants had to infer synergies from monotherapy data alone[5].\n\n**Insights from Transcriptomics and Biological Mechanisms**\n- New analyses in Gustavo's own lab highlighted the complexity at the molecular level: combining two drugs could result in novel gene expression changes not predictable from the effects of either drug alone.\n- For some combinations, the set of differentially expressed genes was much larger than the union of those affected by individual drugs\u2014implying that synergy at a transcriptional level can create emergent effects[5].\n- Predicting synergy requires a deeper molecular understanding, as many current models, which focus on classical targets, might miss important downstream transcriptional changes.\n\n**Next Steps and New Challenges**\n- Gustavo previewed a new, larger-scale drug combination prediction challenge (in partnership with AstraZeneca and Sanger), expanding from 91 to over 13,000 drug pairs and 1 to 79 cell lines from multiple tissue types[1].\n- In the new challenge, participants would receive only baseline (pre-treatment) molecular data and a training set, reflecting a more practical and scalable approach for real-world applications[1].\n- The field was moving from simply ranking synergy scores to attempting to predict actual synergy values and to identifying the most synergistic partners for a given drug or cell line.\n\n**Conclusions**\n- Community challenges can rapidly accelerate research by engaging large groups (90+ researchers from 31 teams participated), often advancing the field by several person-years in just a few months[5].\n- It is possible to predict drug synergy computationally even without direct combinatorial training data, but current methods still have significant limitations.\n- Methods may need to model synergy and antagonism separately; transcriptomic-based predictions require a molecular understanding of emergent gene-level effects.\n- There is a need for new experiments and advanced models to uncover the molecular mechanisms driving synergy.\n- Collaboration, crowdsourcing, and data sharing are essential for advancing in silico methods for drug combination discovery[5][1].\n\n**Broad Takeaway:**  \nComputational challenges like DREAM are crucial for benchmarking and advancing the science of drug synergy prediction. The findings emphasize the complexity of biological systems, the limitations of current models, and the value of collective scientific effort in tackling big biomedical questions[5][1]."}, "Model 1": {"real_model": "openai", "summary": "Gustavo Stolovitzky's talk primarily focused on a computational challenge aimed at predicting drug synergy, organized in collaboration with the DREAM project and the NCI. Here are the main points from his presentation:\n\n1. **Drug Synergy Importance**: Gustavo stressed the importance of synergistic interactions between drugs as a strategy to reduce resistance to treatments. This is vital because cancer treatments often lead to relapses due to acquired resistance.\n\n2. **Challenge Objective**: The DREAM challenge was designed to benchmark methods that could predict drug combinations with synergistic effects. Given the vast number of possible drug combinations (e.g., 1,000 drugs resulting in a million pairs), in silico methods are necessary to prioritize potential combinations effectively.\n\n3. **Challenge Design**: Initially set around 2012, the challenge involved evaluating 91 combinations of 14 drugs in a lymphoma cell line, asking participants to rank these combinations based on their synergistic potential.\n\n4. **Data Provided**: Participants were given rich data, including gene expression profiles before and after treatment, DNA copy number variations, and SNPs, to aid in their predictions.\n\n5. **Synergy Measurement**: The talk detailed how synergy was measured using an \"excess over Bliss independence\" method. He explained the concept of Bliss independence, where drug effects are probabilistically assessed as independent.\n\n6. **Results and Insights**: The challenge uncovered that while some approaches were promising, no method was universally superior. Interestingly, predictions for synergistic and antagonistic interactions seemed to rely on different mechanisms.\n\n7. **Approaches Described**: Gustavo described the methods of the best-performing teams, noting that the prediction models used were purely mathematical and did not involve a training set, only baseline data for monotherapies.\n\n8. **Follow-up Work and New Challenges**: Gustavo's lab pursued further work to understand how synergistic effects manifest at the molecular level, such as through transcriptional changes. Moreover, he announced a scaled-up future challenge that increases the number of combinations and cell lines, aiming to further test the community's capabilities in predicting drug synergy.\n\n9. **Conclusion and Implications**: He concluded that predicting drug synergy is possible without training data but requires better modeling distinctions between synergy and antagonism. Transcriptomics can provide valuable insights into these interactions, suggesting new experiments and computational models are needed to improve predictions.\n\n10. **Discussion Points**: In the Q&A, Gustavo highlighted the complexity of drug targets and the potential of new computational algorithms to predict transcriptional changes as molecular targets.

These infected hepatocytes showed high expression of heat shock proteins and activation of the unfolded protein response, indicating cellular stress due to viral infection.\n\n2. **Cellular Composition and Expression State Alterations**: The COVID-19 liver exhibited extensive changes in cellular composition and expression states, reflecting hepatocellular injury, ductular reaction, pathologic vascular expansion, and fibrogenesis. These changes were observed despite the absence of clinical acute liver injury phenotypes.\n\n3. **Kupffer Cell Proliferation and Erythrocyte Progenitors**: For the first time in a human liver single-cell atlas, the study observed Kupffer cell proliferation and the presence of erythrocyte progenitors, resembling responses seen in liver injury in mice and sepsis.\n\n4. **Endothelial Cell Impact**: The endothelial cell composition was dramatically altered in COVID-19, with significant changes in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and other endothelial populations. These changes were associated with profibrogenic activation and angiogenesis.\n\n5. **Fibrogenic Activation**: The mesenchymal compartment showed significant fibrogenic activation, with increased proportions of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), contributing to liver fibrosis.\n\n6. **Pathological Expansion of Cholangiocytes**: The study identified a pathological expansion of reactive cholangiocytes and hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs), indicative of a ductular reaction, which is a response to liver injury and fibrosis.\n\n7. **Cellular Communication Networks**: The study revealed active fibrogenesis mediated by altered cellular communication networks, particularly involving hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal cells. Key signaling pathways included VEGF, TGF-\u03b2, and BMP, which are crucial for liver regeneration and fibrosis.\n\n8. **Histopathological Validation**: Histopathological analysis confirmed the presence of extensive pro-fibrotic changes, including stellate cell activation and sinusoidal fibrosis, in COVID-19 liver samples.\n\nOverall, the study provides novel insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying liver pathology in COVID-19, highlighting the complex interplay between direct viral infection, systemic inflammation, and fibrogenic responses. This foundational resource will aid in further investigations and understanding of COVID-19-related liver injury and its long-term implications."}}, "rankings": {"Model 2": 1, "Model 1": 2}, "quality_scores": {"Model 1": 2, "Model 2": 7}}

The models compared are ST-Net, HisToGene, Hist2ST, STimage, DeepSpaCE, and BLEEP.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n- **Top-Performing Models:**  \n  The study identifies Hist2ST, BLEEP, and STimage as the **consistently top-performing models** in terms of predictive accuracy (Pearson correlation coefficient, PCC) across both ID and OOD test scenarios. These methods outperform the others on both legacy (HER2+) and higher-resolution (Visium) spatial transcriptomics datasets[1].\n\n- **Dataset-Specific Leaders:**  \n  - On the **HER2+ dataset** (lower resolution), **BLEEP** and **STimage** show significantly better performance than the other models.\n  - On the **Visium dataset** (higher resolution), **Hist2ST** achieves the highest and most consistent performance across all evaluated genes[1].\n\n- **OOD Generalization:**  \n  In OOD tests (where models are evaluated on data from different distributions/labs), **STimage** demonstrates the highest median performance. **Hist2ST**, while performing very well on validation data, shows a pronounced drop in OOD performance, suggesting a tendency to overfit the training set. BLEEP and STimage demonstrate more robust and consistent OOD performance, likely due to their architectural approaches in dealing with uncertainty and inference strategies[1].\n\n- **Modifications and Additional Techniques:**  \n  Attempts to improve Hist2ST with data augmentation, stain normalization, auxiliary classification loss, pre-trained backbones, or architectural simplification did not result in performance improvements. Notably, using pre-trained encoders even reduced performance, suggesting domain-specific feature learning is critical[1].\n\n### Model Rankings (as described in the study)\n\n| Model      | In-Distribution (ID) | Out-of-Distribution (OOD) | Notes                                                      |\n|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hist2ST    | Top                  | Drops in OOD              | Most accurate on Visium; overfits, less robust OOD         |\n| STimage    | Top                  | Top                       | Most robust across OOD; models uncertainty                 |\n| BLEEP      | Top                  | Top                       | Scalable, robust OOD, uses embedding/nearest-neighbors     |\n| HisToGene  | Moderate             | Moderate                  | Slightly lower than above                                  |\n| ST-Net     | Low                  | Low                       | Consistently lower, below 0.1 median PCC                   |\n| DeepSpaCE  | Low                  | Low                       | Consistently lower, below 0.1 median PCC                   |\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **No single model is best across all scenarios.**  \n  **Hist2ST** is the highest performer on in-distribution (particularly Visium) data, but **STimage** and **BLEEP** exhibit greater robustness and generalizability, especially for OOD data[1].\n- **STimage** is highlighted as the top model for generalization to new, unseen datasets, an essential criterion for practical applications, while **Hist2ST** leads when training and test data are closely matched.\n- The overall performance remains modest for all methods, with median correlations for most genes between 0.1 and 0.3, indicating this is still a challenging, open problem.\n\n> In summary, **Hist2ST, STimage, and BLEEP are the best-performing models according to this study, with STimage and BLEEP showing the most robust out-of-distribution generalization, and Hist2ST excelling on in-distribution data**[1].\n\n---\n\n[1] https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/9GwDVJ69/"}}, "rankings": {"Model 2": 1, "Model 1": 2}, "quality_scores": {"Model 1": 6, "Model 2": 9}}
