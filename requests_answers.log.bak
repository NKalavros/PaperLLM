Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomic profiling identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hepatocytes, exhibiting expression profiles akin to infected lung epithelial cells. Key findings include marked changes in cellular composition and expression states, such as hepatocellular injury, ductular reaction, pathologic vascular expansion, fibrogenesis, and the emergence of erythrocyte progenitors. This work underlines the regenerative capacity loss in COVID-19 livers and provides critical insights into the long-term impact of the disease on liver physiology."}}}

Key findings include:\n\n1. **SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hepatocytes**: Hepatocytes were identified as the primary liver cell type infected by SARS-CoV-2, exhibiting expression profiles similar to infected lung epithelial cells, including upregulation of heat shock proteins and interferon signaling pathways.\n\n2. **Liver Cellular Remodeling**: COVID-19 livers showed extensive changes in cellular composition, including hepatocellular injury, ductular reaction, vascular expansion, and fibrogenesis. Reactive cholangiocytes and profibrogenic mesenchymal cells were notably expanded.\n\n3. **Immune and Endothelial Alterations**: Kupffer cell proliferation and the emergence of erythrocyte progenitors were observed, alongside significant changes in endothelial cell composition, suggesting a pro-fibrotic and angiogenic response.\n\n4. **Spatial and Functional Disruption**: Spatial transcriptomics revealed altered zonation patterns, with hepatocyte proliferation in Zone 1 and hypoxia/stress responses in Zone 3, indicating a spatially orchestrated COVID-19-specific liver phenotype.\n\n5. **Fibrogenic Activation**: Mesenchymal cells, particularly hepatic stellate cells, were activated, contributing to fibrosis, validated by histopathology showing extensive sinusoidal fibrosis and ductular reaction in COVID-19 livers.\n\nThis atlas provides foundational insights into COVID-19-induced liver pathology, highlighting both direct viral effects and systemic responses, and offers a resource for further investigation into liver-related sequelae of COVID-19."}}}
