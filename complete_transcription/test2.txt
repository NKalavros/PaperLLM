Alright, so this is the first segment of 30 seconds that I will record using this.  It's all awkward talking to yourself, bro.  It is working correctly for macOS and for Linux.  I'm not making a Windows implementation for the life of me.  This is basically for me to show to Gustavo E1 in half hours. No, I'm now trying a slightly different variation of this, where I'm using a larger model just  to quantify how fast it will record.  The problem is that because this is an Apple Silicon, it doesn't have a traditional GPU,  so it works slower than Nvidia.  But on the other hand, if I'm doing this locally, you don't really have an Nvidia right now.  So, well, what can you do? if it can pick up how tired I am.  Then it's now going to transcription part after recording for 30 seconds  and we're doing at the same time using threading  it's recording the second segment.  Transcription for one segment of 30 seconds  takes around 40 seconds, actually 23 seconds, so effectively it does happen in  real time  or with like a Oh, let's see. It started transcribing the first 30 seconds, while it is also recording the second 30 seconds.  And I don't have any more commentary.  Oh my god, a power of two.  What?  A power of two detected.  What? 2048 patients  So the loop overhead is 0.0001 seconds and the transcription is actually done in 35 seconds  Yeah, yeah, it's effectively real-time like I don't care if you have to wait one minute after the talk  Some people have reported that the You know, the model is better, so I don't know.  I just have to do a few tests.  I need to go to watch a movie at some point.  I am not making the best of my subscription yet.  Did you see Sarah's?  Yes.  She was a good.  So, um, are you a fan of thrillers?  Like, I could be, but I'm not a fan. Yeah, so the first part deals with the social implications of the minor.  This is during the Jim Crow era.  And there's two entrepreneurial black dudes who recruit a cousin of theirs  who is a musician and apparently also some kind of shaman.  As in, he has the power to summon spirits from the past and the future.  How spoilers do you want me to tell you?
